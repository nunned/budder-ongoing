Application is split into two main pages, and a user-menu with sub-menu items allowing control over user's facility (Strain Management, Location Management,). In the future expanding to features like employee management.

Two main pages will be chat-page and dashboard-page. Chat page allows user to communicate with their data, there will also be a failsafe command system so that the user can interface any of the forms through /help. The dashboard page allows users to visualize their data, viewing data organized by plants, transfers, packages and more. Dash-board page also has sub pages that allow for more detailed view.

Bulk of the work will be to connect the neccessary endpoints to the frontend. There are still some components that need to be developed, mainly in the dashboard page and user settings.
